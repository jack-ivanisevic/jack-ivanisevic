I work at the intersection of CRM strategy, lifecycle automation, technical engineering, and data-driven development.  
I build reliable systems, clean data structures, optimized lifecycle programs, and automation workflows that help organizations scale with clarity and precision.

My background spans CRM/email platforms, custom automation, API integrations, full-stack concepts, data modeling, and applied AI/ML. I bridge the gap between marketing and engineering — delivering solutions that are functional, maintainable, and measurable.

## Fun Fact

CRM, email automation, and coding are so enjoyable to me that they rarely feel like “work.”  
I’ve always resonated with the quote often attributed to Confucius:  
**“Choose a job you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.”**
