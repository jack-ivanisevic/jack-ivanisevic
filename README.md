## 👋 About Me

I’m a senior-level **CRM & Email Marketing Contractor** with a hybrid background spanning:

- **Email marketing & lifecycle strategy**  
- **CRM platform migrations (Mailchimp → Klaviyo, SFMC familiarity)**  
- **Technical automation, data workflows & integrations**  
- **Marketing analytics, tracking & optimization**  

I bridge the gap between **marketing** and **engineering**, making it easier for brands to manage audiences, automate communication, and improve performance across their digital stack.

I also bring formal **AI/ML training** that strengthens my ability to build predictive segments, scoring models, and intelligent automation flows.

I’m passionate about clean data, elegant workflows, and systems that deliver value at scale.
