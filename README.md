## 👋 About Me

I’m a senior-level **CRM & Email Marketing Contractor** with a hybrid background across:

- **Email marketing + lifecycle strategy**  
- **CRM platform migrations (Mailchimp → Klaviyo, SFMC familiarity)**  
- **Technical data work, integrations & automations**  
- **Marketing analytics, tracking & optimization**  

I bridge the gap between **marketing** and **engineering**, making it easier for brands to manage audiences, automate communication, and optimize performance across their digital stack.

I’m passionate about clean data, elegant workflows, and email systems that actually deliver value.
