## About Me

I am a senior hybrid professional with a unique blend of capabilities across:

- **Full-stack development (frontend, backend, integrations, systems)**  
- **CRM, email marketing, lifecycle automation, and customer data management**  
- **Technical automation, event-based workflows, and data-driven personalization**  
- **AI/ML foundations applied to segmentation, scoring, and efficiency optimization**

My background spans software engineering, CRM platform migrations, analytics design, automation strategy, and multi-client technical execution. I thrive at the intersection of development, marketing systems, and intelligent automation.

I specialize in building solutions that are scalable, maintainable, and designed around real business goals. Whether I’m writing code, architecting a CRM migration, or designing a multi-step automation, my focus is always on reliability, performance, and clarity.

## Fun Fact

CRM, email marketing, and coding are genuinely so enjoyable for me that they rarely feel like work. As an old saying goes, “Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never work a day in your life.” — often credited to Mark Twain
